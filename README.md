This is a project made for the course mobile develoment at Grit Academy.

It provides a login/register flow powered by Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).

Once logged in, a user can choose to upload an image with a caption, and when uploaded they may choose to add to their own personal gallery, which can be seen on a seperate page (navigated to from the navbar). Here they can see all images they have uploaded and delete images.
